# Project 1

The purpose of this project was to calculate some statistics and probability concepts using the data of ranking for US universities in CS with four criteria of CS ranking based on US news, the value of Research Overhead, Admin Base Pay, and Out-of-state Tuition. 

In addition, the probability of the variables have been determined and, by considering the correlation between each variable and constructing a Bayesian network, this probability has been improved by obtaining a higher probability for the variables in terms of log-likelihood.
